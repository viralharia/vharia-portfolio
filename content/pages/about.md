Hi, my name is _**Viral Haria**_. Iâ€™m a Software Consultant currently living in _Thane, India._


I have been working as a software developer in various roles for the last 10 years and 
currently working as a back-end engineer (Java web apps) with [Capgemini
](https://www.capgemini.com/in-en/)

I started my career as a front-end engineer working on **Actionscript 3** and **Adobe Flex** language and transitioned to back-end engineer 5 years ago.


Currently, I am looking for a new career opportunity in _Toronto, Canada_ area as we are planning to emigrate there in March 2020 (Have a valid PR/work permit).

**__**

**_A little bit more about me. Like anyone cares._**

I am passionate about everything related to software 
development and love building great products/applications for people.


When I am not being a jerk by forgetting to mute my microphone or un-mute it in calls, 
eating all the office candy, and showing up for work on time every day, 
I enjoy movies, reading articles from my huge pocket's backlog and enjoy playing with our 1 year old son.
