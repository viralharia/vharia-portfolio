## Creation of a Promise
```js
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // executor (the producing code, "singer")
});
```
* When `new Promise` is created, it runs automatically.
* The function passed to new Promise is called the **_executor_**.
  + Its arguments `resolve` and `reject` are callbacks provided by JavaScript itself. Our code is only inside the executor.
  + When the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late – doesn’t matter, it should call one of these callbacks:
    + `resolve(value)` — if the job finished successfully, with result value.
    + `reject(error)` — if an error occurred, error is the error object.

Simple example:
```js
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

// async operation such as DB, I/O or API calls

if(promise_kept)
  resolve("done");
else
  reject(new Error("…"));
  
});
```

## Handling of or consuming a promise : then, catch, finally
### then
```js
promise.then(
  function(result) { /* handle a successful result */ },
  function(error) { /* handle an error */ }
);
```
* The first argument of `.then` is a function that runs when the promise is resolved, and receives the result.

* The second argument of `.then` is a function that runs when the promise is rejected, and receives the error.
* If we’re interested only in successful completions, then we can provide only one function argument to `.then`

### catch
* When a promise rejects, the control jumps to the closest rejection handler. 
* the `.catch` doesn’t have to be immediate. It may appear after one or maybe several `.then`
* If we’re interested only in errors, we can use .catch(errorHandlingFunction)

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Whoops!")), 1000);
});

// .catch(f) is the same as promise.then(null, f)
promise.catch(alert); // shows "Error: Whoops!" after 1 second
```
* `.catch` handles errors in promises of all kinds: be it a `reject()` call, or an error thrown in a handler.
* We should place `.catch` exactly in places where we want to handle errors and know how to handle them. The handler should analyze errors (custom error classes help) and rethrow unknown ones (maybe they are programming mistakes).
* It’s ok not to use .catch at all, if there’s no way to recover from an error.
* In any case we should have the `unhandledrejection` event handler (for browsers, and analogs for other environments), to track unhandled errors and inform the user (and probably our server) about the them, so that our app never “just dies”

### finally
* `finally` is a good handler for performing cleanup, e.g. stopping our loading indicators, as they are not needed anymore, no matter what the outcome is.

```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  /* do something that takes time, and then call resolve/reject */
})
  // runs when the promise is settled, doesn't matter successfully or not
  .finally(() => stop loading indicator)
  .then(result => show result, err => show error)
```

* A `finally` handler has no arguments. In finally we don’t know whether the promise is successful or not. That’s all right, as our task is usually to perform “general” finalizing procedures.
* A `finally` handler passes through results and errors to the next handler.

## Promises chaining
It looks like this:
```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000); // (*)

}).then(function(result) { // (**)

  alert(result); // 1
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) { // (***)

  alert(result); // 2
  return result * 2;

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4
  return result * 2;

});
```

The idea is that the result is passed through the chain of `.then` handlers.

Here the flow is:

1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second (*),
2. Then the .then handler is called (**).
3. The value that it returns is passed to the next `.then` handler (***) 
4. …and so on.

As the result is passed along the chain of handlers, we can see a sequence of alert calls: 1 → 2 → 4.

> The whole thing works, because a call to `promise.then` returns > a promise, so that we can call the next `.then` on it.
> When a handler returns a value, it becomes the result of that 
> promise, so the next `.then` is called with it.

The above example is same as below:
```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 1

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // (*)
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });

}).then(function(result) { // (**)

  alert(result); // 2

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(result * 2), 1000);
  });

}).then(function(result) {

  alert(result); // 4

});
```

## Async/await
### Async functions
* The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.

For instance, this function returns a resolved promise with the result of 1, let’s test it:
```js
async function f() {
  return 1;
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```

…We could explicitly return a promise, that would be the same:
```js
async function f() {
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}

f().then(alert); // 1
```

### Await
* The keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.

```js
async function f() {

  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
  });

  let result = await promise; // wait till the promise resolves (*)

  alert(result); // "done!"
}

f();
```
