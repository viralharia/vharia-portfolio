## OutOfMemory Error related:
- ### XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath 
  - In order to diagnose `OutOfMemoryError` or any memory related problem, one would have to capture heap dump right at the moment or few moments before the application starts to experience `OutOfMemoryError`. 
  - Capturing heap dumps can be automated by passing following JVM arguments when you launch the application in the command line:
  - Once heap dumps are captured, you can use tools like **HeapHero**, **Eclipse MAT** to analyze heap dumps.
```java
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError and -XX:HeapDumpPath={HEAP-DUMP-FILE-PATH}
```
Example:
```java
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/crashes/my-heap-dump.hprof
```

- ### -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError
  - You can configure JVM to invoke any script when `OutOfMemoryError` is thrown. Most of the time, `OutOfMemoryError` doesn’t crash the application. However, it’s better to restart the application, once `OutOfMemoryError` happens. Because `OutOfMemoryError` can potentially leave application in an unstable state.

```java
-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=/scripts/restart-myapp.sh
```
 - 
   - When you pass this argument, JVM will invoke “/scripts/restart-myapp.sh” script whenever OutOfMemoryError is thrown. In this script, you can write code to restart your application gracefully.
